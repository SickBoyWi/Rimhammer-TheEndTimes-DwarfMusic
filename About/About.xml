This mod adds new music to the RimWorld game. It is themed to go along with the Rimhammer - The End Times - Dwarfs mod, but would go well with any fantasy style game you want to include it with. This mod does disable vanilla RimWorld music.

You can add or remove this to or from ongoing games without issue.

All of the music in this mod was used with the permission of and made by Derek Fiechter and Brandon Fiechter. Their most epic collection of fantasy music can be found at their YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjMZjGhrFq_4llVS_x2XJ_w
